Habeas corpus began in England.

In their brief, the members of Parliament warn about the danger of suspending habeas: ""During the British Civil War, the British created their own version of Guantanamo Bay and dispatched undesirable prisoners to garrisons off the mainland, beyond the reach of habeas corpus relief.""

And why they're wrong. On the Christian side of this argument is Pastor Russell Johnson of the Ohio Restoration Project, which is trying to recruit ""patriot pastors"" to get involved in state politics; and Bill Carrico, a Virgina legislator who's trying to make sure people can express their Christianity in schools and other public places. And then there are the videos and speeches of David Barton, whose group, Wallbuilders, is trying to teach people that the founding fathers meant for America to be a Christian country. On the other side are Rob Boston, spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and Cornell government professor Isaac Kramnick, co-author of The Godless Constitution.

In this election year, one question is rarely asked in a very direct way: Is the Bush Administration competent at conducting the war on terror? Every few weeks it seems like there's more news about how badly it's going: Senior Administration officials like Colin Powell now admit the insurgency in Iraq is growing; terror suspects like Yasir Hamdi (who supposedly were so dangerous that having a lawyer talk to them about their case would compromise national security) are released without trial because the evidence against them is so flimsy; there was the Abu Ghraib prison scandal; and just this week, the former head of the U.S. operation in Iraq, Paul Bremer, declared the problem from the start was that there were not enough troops there. Host Ira Glass discusses whether the Bush Administration is simply not very skilled at fighting terror with Richard Perle and James Fallows. Perle was one of the early advocates in Administration circles of going to war in Iraq. During the run-up to the war, he was chairman of the Defense Policy Board, a civilian advisory panel in the Pentagon.

Working in a poultry processing plant is one of the most unpleasant jobs you can get in this country. It's low-paid, dangerous and difficult. Barely any poultry plants are represented by a union, especially in the South, where most of the plants are located. So worker rights advocates rely in large part on the church to help them organize workers. And in the past few years, they've been trying something new: They've been using the church to intervene with company management in a very, very personal way. This American Life producer Sarah Koenig tells the story of how one organizer tried this method with a manager at a company called Case Farms, and a plant they have in Morganton, North Carolina.

It's part of an Amish tradition called rumspringa, which lets Amish kids drive cars and drink and party for a few years, before they decide whether or not to be baptised into the Amish church and live an Amish life. Now 21, Faron explains to Ira why most Amish kids decide to stay Amish after rumspringa, and why, at 21, he hasn't. He's featured in a documentary called Devil's Playground, by filmmaker Lucy Walker.

Jeffs had been in charge of the FLDS church, and also of the giant trust which church members paid into all their lives. But when Jeffs became a fugitive, he began to mismanage the $112 million trust, and so the Utah attorney general stepped in, giving Wisan control. Wisan had plans: He was going to modernize the town utilities, improve the roads, and most important, give people titles to their homes, which under Jeffs were owned and controlled by the church trust. But Wisan quickly ran into an enormous problem: The majority of people in Short Creek would have nothing to do with him or his ideas. Claire Hoffman reports.

So he came up with a plan to allow the small farmers to grow, if they registered with his office. Growers would pay for little zip-ties they could put around the base of their marijuana plants, and the cops would know to leave them alone. It saved time and generated revenue.

It's possible that the very first teenager to heed his invitation was Hyder Akbar, 17, from Concord, California. In the summer of 2002, he travelled with his father to live in their home country. As luck would have it, he met a radio producer named Susan Burton before he left, and she gave him a tape recorder to take along. This show is devoted to his extraordinary recordings. In Kabul, Akbar learns to use a Kalashnikov and spends his days with his one-eyed war-hero uncle. By the end of the summer his father is appointed the official spokesman for the new Afghan government, which gives him insider's access to everything important that happens in Kabul. He meets warlords and sees the President. Hours after a bomb explodes in a market, he walks through the bloody, glass-strewn marketplace. 
A year later, in the summer of 2003, Hyder returned to Afghanistan and recorded stories that are, if anything, even more amazing than the ones in this show. That show, Teenage Embed, Part Two, takes place in Kunar province, where Hyder's dad was appointed governor.

In this election year we look at the story of one small ballot initiative, in one state. We heard this referendum would gut Georgia's Judicial Qualifications Commission (JQC), an independent organization that investigates ethics complaints about judges. Years ago, the JQC investigated a judge we did a whole episode about, Amanda Williams, and she resigned from the bench. We wondered why in the world someone would want to tamper with an agency that seemed to be doing a good job at a low cost. Producer David Kestenbaum went to Georgia to figure out what was going on.

Say there's a group of five people standing on a train track, and you're on a train coming toward them. You can save the whole group by pulling a lever and switching to another track, but the catch is that you'll kill another person who's standing on that other track. Do you pull the lever?According to Harvard scientist Mark Hauser, who posed this question to hundreds of thousands of people on the Internet, nine out of 10 people say yes, they would pull the lever. But then, the questions get harderâ€”and the answers much more confusing. It turns out that different parts of our brains make different moral decisions.

There's one group of people that is universally tarred and feathered in the United States and most of the world. We never hear from them, because they can't identify themselves without putting their livelihoods and reputations at risk. That group is pedophiles. It turns out lots of them desperately want help, but because it's so hard to talk about their situation it's almost impossible for them to find it. Reporter Luke Malone spent a year and a half talking to people in this situation, and he has this story about one of them. More of Luke Malone's reporting on this topic is available on Medium.com.

The boys were brandishing a shotgun and firing it into the air. What happened in the months that followed after police got involved and charges were filed didn't seem fair to either side. Susan begins the story by talking about the incident with the girls. For Native Americans, the event fit into what they see as a decades-longâ€”or maybe centuries-longâ€”pattern of injustice. And the event traumatized the girls so much that in the months after, one of them underwent an almost complete personality transformation, and another became suicidal.

Mark Oppenheimer reports on agunah in the Orthodox Jewish community. An agunah is a woman whose husband refuses to give her a divorce â€“ in Hebrew it means ""chained wife."" If you're an Orthodox Jew, strictly following Jewish law, the only real way to get divorced is if your husband agrees to hand you a piece of paper called a get. Without the get, women who want out of their marriages can stay chained to their husbands for years. In New York, a couple of rabbis were recently accused of using violence to force men to give their wives a get. Mark writes the Beliefs column for The New York Times.

Asperger Syndrome, symptoms of which include emotional distance,
inflexibility and missing social cues. Kristin and her co-workers often
joked that all their husbands had Asperger's, since the symptoms overlap
with stereotypically male personality traits. But then Kristen wonderedâ€”what if it was actually true for her husband Dave? The quiz that Dave Finch
took to determine whether he had Aspergers can be found online (note: it's
not an official diagnostic tool). Dave wrote a book about this experience,
called The Journal of Best Practices.
